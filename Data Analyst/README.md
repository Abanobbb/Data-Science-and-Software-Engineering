## Programming series
#### 1- Programming Level (0) [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ4zTapHSRI&list=PL73bE5x5W-IDgkSxUQx9GCv0vBQPjBNuJ)
In this level, you will learn the fundamental of programming in general without writing specific programming language codes. The lessons start by defining the *Problem*, *Computational Problem* and *Algorithm*. After that, you will learn how to write algorithms by *Pseudo-code* and *Flowchart*. During that you will learn the fundamental terminologies for programmings like *Statements*, *Expressions* and *Boolean Expressions* and different statements as *If*, *For-Loop*, *While-Loop* and *Functions*. In the end, you will be able to know what you need to learn programming (e.g. *IDE*) and able to choose the suitable programming language for your needs.

#### 2- Python - Level (1), Basics [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1m9rtZYN-4&list=PL73bE5x5W-ICe8Wb9bFK85FFFGXbNtMx5)
In this level, you will apply all the concepts of programming level 0. At the end of this level, there is a project about ATM which helps you to apply such concepts and think in the level of components (functions).
#### 3- Python - Level (2), OOP \[Part 1] [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65LBTWC9OUo&list=PL73bE5x5W-ICjN2bL9On_dtReRSBRr8Fz)
This level only has the lessons of Object-Oriented Programming  (OOP) which is necessary for Data Analyst and Scientist. The remaining concepts of OOP are on another level. 
#### 3- Python - Level (3), Tricks [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdUOgE-73To&list=PL73bE5x5W-IAhtvykYAe9T3un76xkexVx)
In this level, I finalize the Python programming language by going through its documentation and teach all missed points and tricks.
## Analysis series
#### 1- Descriptive Statistics by Python [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmSVoAyY1LM&list=PL73bE5x5W-ICemDprdzo0HibsFiUQIEM5)
This is the first version of Descriptive analysis courses that is enough for Junior Data analysts. Seniors Data analysts must learn more about multivariate statistics. 
#### 2- Data Cleaning by Python [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
Usually, the data you are working with having troubles as missing values and outliers. One of your tasks is to be able to clean the data before analysis.
## Data Acquisition series
Data acquisition means reading the data from its source. Since Data analyst usually works on companies that have their data stored in a database, Data Analyst recruiters expect your ability to read such data from their database. 
#### 1- Database Level (1) – SQL - Python/SQL [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
Databases courses usually have diverse topics for different skills such as you and Data Engineers. In this course, you will just learn the skills that help you to read the data you need to analyze from the database. 
#### 2- Data Formats XML/JSON/… [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
Sometimes data are not stored in a relational database, however, is stored in files with specific formats like XML, JSON and so on. Data analysts are expected to be able to handle such files.
## Technologies series
One of the following courses is enough. These are the programs that help you in your work with less programming. I will not record these courses but will give you links to courses in English to be ready to be professional. 

#### 1- Tabulae
#### 2- Power bi
