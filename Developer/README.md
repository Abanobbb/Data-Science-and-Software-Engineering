## Programming series
#### 1- Programming Level (0) [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-IDgkSxUQx9GCv0vBQPjBNuJ)
In this level, you will learn the fundamental of programming in general without writing specific programming language codes. After that course, you will have enough knowledge about what is meant by a programming language (e.g. concepts and tools[IDE]) and choose the suitable programming language for your needs.

#### 2- Java - Level (1), Basics  [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-IDK_ksDRHQRDW_7qvUAWgfy)
In this level, you will apply all the concepts of programming level 0. At the end of this level, there is a project about ATM which helps you to apply such concepts and think in the level of components (functions).

#### 3- Java - Level (2), OOP [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-IDXOPAssRtlfJzh_Dbl9wxL)
In this level, you will learn the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to be able to organize larger projects. These concepts are 
* Classes and Objects 
* Encapsulation 
* Composition 
* Inheritance
* Casting 
* Polymorphism 
* Abstraction
* Interfaces

There is a project at the end in which you will apply all the concepts of OOP. 

#### 4- Java - Level (3), Tricks [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
In this level, you will go through Java documentation. After that you will learn the following 
* Try and Catch 
* Wrapping Classes
* Strings, from encodind to manipulation. 
* Math Class, System class, Object class, and some other important classes. 
* Streams and Files
* Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Memory Management. 
* What is after JDK8
* Some tricks
* J2SE packages in general.

#### 5- Java - GUI [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-IA8t-LdfAli-7uM9ctsZzrJ)
After this level, you will be able to develop desktop applications. 

#### 6- Java - Applied Data Structure [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-ICLzNwt5aAjnstOlqNgtqMJ)
In this level, you will learn the main data structures like Linear, Tree and Graph and how to use them. This level does not include how these data structures built from Arrays and nodes as well as does not include the theoretical illustration of their crossponding operations. 
## Data Acquisition
Data acquisition means reading the data from its source. Since Developers usually work on companies that have their data stored in databases, Developer recruiters expect your ability to read such data from their database. 
#### 1- Database Level (1) – SQL - Java/SQL [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
Databases courses usually have diverse topics for different skills such as Data analysts, Developers and Data Engineers. In this course, you will just learn the skills that help you to create database and access the data you need from the database.
#### 2- Data Formats XML/JSON/… [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
Sometimes data are not stored in a relational database, however, is stored in files with specific formats like XML, JSON and so on. Developers are expected to be able to handle such files.
